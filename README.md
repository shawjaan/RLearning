## R: An introduction to Graphs

### Barcharts
The most basic graphic for the most basic data. Great for starting analysis. 

We need to create a summary table to use bar charts.
Example: cylinders (a variable) <- table(mtcars$cyl)

### Histograms
Used to data that is quantitative, scaled, measured, interval.
It allows to see what we have.

We look for the Shape, Gaps in distribution, Outliers, and Symmetry in the Histograms.

### Scatterplots
used when we want to visualize the association between two quantitative variables.

We look if our two variables are Linear, consistent Spread, Outliers, and Corralation.

### Overlayiny Plots
We get increased infomation densisty, but we should use restraint. 

## R: An introduction to Basic Statistics
After we have done the graphs we want to get some precision.

Example:
Count -> for categories
Quartiles & mean -> for quantitative variables 

### Summary()
Categorical variable -> get the count of 
Quantitive variable -> the Min, Meadian, and Max

### Describe()
gets more detail.

Example: n, mean, SD, median,10% trimmed mean, MAD, min/max, range. 

### Selecting Cases
Focus on analysis.
