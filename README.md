## Barcharts
The most basic graphic for the most basic data. Great for starting analysis. 

We need to create a summary table to use bar charts.
Example: cylinders (a variable) <- table(mtcars$cyl)

## Histograms
Used to data that is quantitative, scaled, measured, interval.
It allows to see what we have.

We look for the Shape, Gaps in distribution, Outliers, and Symmetry in the Histograms.

## Scatterplots
used when we want to visualize the association between two quantitative variables.

We look if our two variables are Linear, consistent Spread, Outliers, and Corralation.
